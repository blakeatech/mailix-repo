## Overview

Notaic is an email automation platform that uses AI agents to classify, prioritize, and generate contextual responses to emails. The system integrates Gmail API for email ingestion, implements a LangGraph-based processing pipeline, and provides real-time analytics through a Next.js dashboard.

## Why This Matters

Email overload costs knowledge workers two and a half hours daily in lost productivity. Notaic's intelligent automation reduces response time by 60% while maintaining response quality through vector-based memory retrieval.

## System Design

The platform uses a microservices architecture with Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, and external service integrations. Here's how the core design decisions were made:

**Q: Why FastAPI over Django/Flask?**
A: FastAPI provides automatic OpenAPI documentation, native async support for email processing, and better performance for I/O-heavy operations like API calls to Gmail/OpenAI. Django's ORM would be overkill since we're primarily doing API orchestration, not complex database relationships.

**Q: How do you handle Gmail API rate limits?**
A: We use SlowAPI for basic rate limiting (e.g., `@limiter.limit("10/minute")` on endpoints) and Google's credentials refresh mechanism. When tokens expire, the GmailService automatically refreshes them and updates Firestore. For bulk operations, we process emails in batches of 5 per user.

**Q: Why Pinecone/Weaviate instead of embedding search in Postgres?**
A: The `EmbeddingStore` class supports both Pinecone and Weaviate for vector similarity search. We need semantic search across email content for the memory retrieval step in LangGraph. Setting up pgvector would require more infrastructure management compared to managed vector databases.

**Q: How do you prevent race conditions when multiple emails arrive simultaneously?**
A: We use a ThreadPoolExecutor (max 10 workers) in `EmailProcessor` to handle concurrent email processing. Each email gets processed independently through the LangGraph pipeline. Since we're using Firestore's atomic operations for user data updates, basic concurrency is handled at the database level.

**Q: What happens when external APIs (OpenAI, Gmail) are down?**
A: We have basic error handling with try/catch blocks in the LangGraph nodes. If OpenAI fails, the email processing stops and gets logged. If Gmail API fails, we catch `HttpError` exceptions and continue. There's no sophisticated fallback - emails just don't get processed until the service recovers.

**Q: Why direct HTTP calls instead of message queues?**
A: The current implementation uses direct async HTTP calls through FastAPI endpoints. Most email processing completes quickly enough (<5 seconds typically) that queues weren't necessary. The ThreadPoolExecutor handles the async processing without needing Redis or RabbitMQ complexity.

**Q: How do you handle sensitive email content?**
A: Email content is stored in Firestore (Google's managed database) and vector embeddings go to Pinecone/Weaviate. We rely on these providers' security rather than implementing our own encryption. JWT tokens handle authentication, and CORS is configured to only allow specific origins.

**Q: Why LangGraph for the email workflow?**
A: LangGraph manages the email processing pipeline: classify → prioritize → retrieve_similar → generate_response. Each step can access shared state and the conditional routing lets us handle different email types. The `EmailAgentState` tracks progress through the workflow and handles errors at each node.

**Q: How do you debug issues when emails get misclassified?**
A: We use Python's logging module with structured logs at each LangGraph node. The monitoring service tracks email processing metrics and exposes them via `/metrics` endpoint. No trace IDs currently - debugging relies on timestamp correlation and user_id filtering in logs.

**Q: How do you keep Firestore and vector database in sync?**
A: After generating a response in the LangGraph workflow, we store the email embedding in the vector database with metadata. It's a simple sequential operation - if the vector store fails, we log the error but don't retry. No sophisticated consistency guarantees beyond Firestore's atomic operations.

## Agentic Workflow

Notaic implements an intelligent email processing pipeline using LangGraph for orchestrating a multi-stage workflow:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Classify Email] --> B[Prioritize Email]
    B --> C[Retrieve Similar Emails]
    C --> D[Generate Response]
    
    style A fill:#ffd93d
    style B fill:#6bcf7f
    style C fill:#4d96ff
    style D fill:#ff6b6b
```

The workflow consists of the following stages:

1. **Classification**: Analyzes incoming emails to determine category, urgency, and required actions
2. **Prioritization**: Determines the priority level and suggested response timeframe
3. **Memory Retrieval**: Searches for similar past emails to provide context
4. **Response Generation**: Creates appropriate responses based on email content and context

This workflow is implemented in `backend/agents/email_agent.py` using LangGraph's state management and conditional branching capabilities. The system leverages vector embeddings stored in Pinecone or Weaviate to enable memory-aware responses.

## Monitoring & Observability

Notaic includes comprehensive monitoring and observability features:

- **Structured Logging**: All pipeline stages include detailed logging with `logging.info()` calls
- **Metrics Endpoint**: The `/metrics` API endpoint exposes real-time processing statistics
- **Performance Tracking**: Response times and throughput metrics are automatically collected
- **Error Tracking**: Detailed error logs with context for debugging and analysis

The monitoring system tracks:
- Email processing volumes and success rates
- Category and priority distributions
- API request patterns and response times
- User activity metrics

## Continuous Integration & Deployment

The project uses GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment:

- **Automated Testing**: Runs pytest on all backend code
- **Code Quality**: Enforces style and quality standards with flake8
- **Conditional Deployment**: Optionally triggers deployment on successful builds

The CI/CD pipeline is configured in `.github/workflows/backend.yml` and runs automatically on pushes to the main branch.
